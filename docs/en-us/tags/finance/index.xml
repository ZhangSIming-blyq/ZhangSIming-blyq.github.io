            Warren Buffett, the stock god, said, &amp;quot;By investing regularly in index funds, an amateur investor who knows nothing can surprisingly often beat most professional investors; index funds track indices and do not rely too much on fund managers; each index fund will invest in dozens or even hundreds of stocks at the same time, which can maximize the diversification of investors&#39; non-market risks; and among all similar index funds also have the lowest fees of all funds of their kind.

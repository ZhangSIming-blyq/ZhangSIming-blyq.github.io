            For people new to Golang and Python, this article explains what closures are as well as sometips that need to know about when using closures in these two programming languages. To make it easier for you to copy down and run on your own server, the code section would provide the package, import, and other repeated parts. The negative aspect is that this results in some redundancy, so please understand if this causes any inconvenience.

            Explain the common usage scenarios of iterators, generators, and yield fields in Python.
Iterators Python object implements iter() and next() methods, we become iterable objects (iterables), through iter() can return an iterator object (iterators).
__iter__() method: return the iterator object itself __next__() method: returns the next element of the container, and raises a StopIteration Exception at the end to terminate the iterator 1lst = [1, 2, 3] 2print(type(lst)) 3new_iter = lst.

            Warren Buffett, the stock god, said, &amp;quot;By investing regularly in index funds, an amateur investor who knows nothing can surprisingly often beat most professional investors; index funds track indices and do not rely too much on fund managers; each index fund will invest in dozens or even hundreds of stocks at the same time, which can maximize the diversification of investors&#39; non-market risks; and among all similar index funds also have the lowest fees of all funds of their kind.
